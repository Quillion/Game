Field is a single field on the board.
It can be of 4 types: Bank, Event, Visit and Shop.
More types will be added in the future.
Main thing used to distinguish Fields are their ids.
Ids of fields are assigned and managed by the Board.

Piece, is a single piece on the board.
It holds properties such as last field visited (to prevent moving back),
how much money he is carrying, and how many stores he owns.

and is one of the main ways to communicate with fields and change their values.
